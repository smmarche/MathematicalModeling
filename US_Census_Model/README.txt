# Method of Least Squares for Exponential Growth Estimation

This repository contains code and data to estimate the growth rate (r) of the United States population from 1790 to 1990 using the method of least squares with an exponential growth model.

## Introduction

The method of least squares is used to find the best-fit exponential growth model that describes the population growth of the United States over the years. This model assumes that the population follows the equation:

x(t) = x0 * e^(rt)

Where:
- `x(t)` is the population at time `t`.
- `x0` is the initial population.
- `r` is the growth rate.
- `t` is the time.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this estimation is the census data of the United States from 1790 to 1990, which is provided in UScensusdata.txt.

For detailed implementation and results, please refer to the code and documentation in this repository.
